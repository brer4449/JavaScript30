      // // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // let age = 100;
      // let age2 = age;
      // console.log(age, age2); // gives what expected: 100, 100
      // age = 200;
      // console.log(age, age2); // gives 200, 100, since the value of age goes into the variable at the same time

      // // same works for strings:
      // let name = "Wes";
      // let name2 = name;
      // console.log(name, name2);
      // name = "wesley";
      // console.log(name, name2);
      // // the VALUE of strings, numbers, booleans go into variable, and if you change the original one, it's ok, NOT going to update the other one.

      // // Let's say we have an array
      // const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // // and we want to make a copy of it.
      // const team = players;

      // // console.log(players, team);

      // // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // team[3] = "lux";
      // // console logging team AND players gives lux as the fourth element...
      // // since we updated team (which is a reference to the original array) the edit is always going to go back to the reference of where it was
      // // which is NOT the same as the first example
      // // If you update an array, it will ALWAYS REFERENCE BACK

      // // however what happens when we update that array?

      // // now here is the problem!

      // // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      // // when nothing is passed into slice, it makes a copy of the array!
      // const team2 = players.slice();
      // // if we change the last element to lux again, the original array (players) stays the same, and team2 is the only one that changes, SINCE TEAM2 IS A COPY

      // // one way

      // // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      // const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // // or use the new ES6 Spread
      // const team4 = [...players];

      // // and last way we can copy is using Array.from:
      // const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 99;
      // // we just made a reference instead of a copy...

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      // start with a blank object, pass in the object you wish to copy all the properties from, then "fold in" the new properties you wish to overwrite
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });

      // // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // const cap3 = { ...person };

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const wes = {
        name: "wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer",
        },
      };
      console.clear();
      console.log(wes);

      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
      // reassigning the name of dev DOES NOT update the original object since it's a REFERENCE
      // if we were to update something in social, it WILL affect the original, since Object.assign only works one level deep...

      // poor man's deep clone (wes does not recommend)
      // JSON.stringify turns the object into a STRING, and then JSON.parse turns it back into an object (not sure about performance)
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
